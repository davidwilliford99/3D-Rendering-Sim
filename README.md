# 3D Renderering Simulation
This project is a sample 3D renderer using numpy and pygame. It supports global object files, and incorporates the different coorinate spaces neccesary for rendering objects to a 2-dimensional screen. This code employs all of the math using numpy.

### This project ...
* Renders 3D objects into world space
* Creates camera for viewing 
* Allows for user to freely move camera
* Converts 3D space within camera to a 2D coordinate system (projection)

### Camera controls 
* W = Forward 
* S = Backward
* A = Left 
* D = Right
* R = Up
* F = Down 
* Q = Rotate Left
* E = Rotate Right 
* H = Return to starting camera position

### To Begin ...
1. Ensure you have python, numpy and pygame installed
2. Run `3D-Projection.py`
3. Enjoy!
